About Us pages are one of the most significant pages on any website. Though there is no perfect formula for putting one together, we've provided some fantastic examples that display how to present some of the elements that are universal to every business's (e.g. name of business, who the business serves, company history, services provided, etc.) About Us page. We hope these templates, site examples and notes will provide a strong jumping off point for any SMB owner or digital marketing professional that is looking to create an About Us page that strengthens consumer confidence and generates more sales.
